# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
At first I struggled with the concept of arrays containing objects but then I
reread it slowly and tried to break it down into a simpler version. Then I
understood. An array can contain any number of similar data types and it caption contain objects (which may consist of different data types).
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
My notes are great. I use colored pens and jot down vocabulary terms and commands. I refer to them later when I get confused. I find it helpful when I write notes while reading the lesson and during class.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I reread the question/issue but slower and multiple times. Then I try to troubleshoot (comment out other code, use console.log). I refer to my notes and if I am really stuck then I'll look it up on google and practice it on my own.
